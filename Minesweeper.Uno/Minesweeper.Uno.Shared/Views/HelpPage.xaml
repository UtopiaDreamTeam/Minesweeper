To play Minesweeper 
    1. On the Game menu, click New. 
    2.To start the timer, click any square on the 
    playing field. 
Notes: 
-The game area consists of the playing 
field, a mine counter, and a timer. 
-You can uncover a square by clicking it. If you 
uncover a mine, you lose the game. 
-If a number appears on a square, it indicates 
how many mines are in the eight squares 
that surround the numbered one. 
-To mark a square you suspect contains a mine, 
right-click it.

-If you are uncertain about a square, right-click 
it twice to mark it with a question mark (?). 
Later, you can either mark the square as a mine 
or uncover it by right-clicking again once or 
twice. 

-When you have marked all mines around a 
numbered square, you can quickly uncover all empty
squares around it by clicking that square 
with both mouse buttons. 
If not all mines touching the square are marked, 
the uncovered touching squares will flash. 

-Look for common patterns in numbers, which often 
indicate a corresponding pattern of mines. 
For example, the pattern 2-3-2 at the edge of a group of uncovered 
squares indicates a row of three mines next to the three numbers.
